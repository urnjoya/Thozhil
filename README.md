## Overview

The app helps users manage their tasks with features like assigning priorities, setting due dates, adding notes, and tracking task completion. The data is stored locally in the browser's **Local Storage**, so tasks persist even after the page is reloaded.

- **Data Persistence**: Uses Local Storage to store user and task data, keeping it between sessions.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface using **Tailwind CSS**.

### Tech Stack:
